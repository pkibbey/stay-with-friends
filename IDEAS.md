# For Later
Move photo storage to s3 bucket

Add Google login as well as magic link login, and do we want email password too? Can we enforce only good secure logins like magic link?

# For now

Go through everything and improve each bit at a time

Prevent page flashes when waiting for page authentication

Add tests when the site needs it later

I would want to make the graphql calls neater, maybe they exist in their own files/folders?
