# For Later
Move photo storage to s3 bucket

Add Google login as well as magic link login, and do we want email password too? Can we enforce only good secure logins like magic link?

# For now

Go through everything and improve each bit at a time

Prevent page flashes when waiting for page authentication

Add a calendar view to the search page also

Improve map pin UI

Save uploaded images as UUIDs instead of their file names, to prevent naming conflicts

Add tests when the site needs it later
