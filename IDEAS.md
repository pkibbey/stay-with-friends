Maybe we could have the person you are staying with as the unique identifier, that you can have multiple people visiting this specific friend, but you can't have a person stay at multiple places in the same night.

Change the word Friends in the title to be the search bar for finding friends 
- make it obvious with animation and have it selected to type initially

Allow the user to start a request to stay at a place

Allow someone to create a new place
  - ignore authentication for now, and just let it be created

If an email is typed in Find Available Friends, suggest the user to invite this person to be a member or to connect with them if they are already a member. Email a link to someone that invites them to a page to add a new place.

Friends can see basic information about their existence, but should not be able to share availability while they are not confirmed as friends.

Friend status can be downgraded anonymously by either party, or by an internal automatic rule based system. Friendship upgrade must require confirmation from both parties.
